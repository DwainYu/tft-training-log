 * Local-first persistence. Everything lives in IndexedDB in this browser;
 * `Export / Import` in the Data page is the only escape hatch, and it is
 * deliberately lossless so the player is never locked in.
 *
 * v2 (Phase 2.5) adds `trainingSessions` and `settings` (active session).
 * There is no real user history yet, so the bump is a plain additive
 * schema change — no migration logic.
 *
 * v3 (Phase 3A) adds `compositionUsage`, a derived per-composition counter
 * for Recent / Frequent / Preset composition picking. Existing v2 databases
 * keep every row; the upgrade backfills usage from the matches that are
 * already there (see the `upgrade` hook) so an upgrading player does not
 * start from an empty table.
